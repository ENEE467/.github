## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to ENEE467

The course is organized in two parts. The first part uses the TI Maze Runner robot. It exemplifies the programming and testing of low-power computer-driven devices. Such devices are ubiquitous. There are hundreds of them operating in our homes, offices, and cars.

The minicomputer in the TI robot does not have a built in operating system or complier. To program it you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This is provided by Texas Instruments in the form of Code Composer Studio, which includes a C/C++ compiler, a source code editor, a project build environment, a debugger, and a profiler.

The second part of the course uses the UR3E robotic arm. This is an example of the other robotic extreme. It is controlled by a desk or laptop computer. Energy for the operation of the computer and the arm comes right from the power plug in the wall. You will need a Linux Machine for this Lab. The lab will help me familiarize yourselves with simulating and moving the manipulator for defined trajectories and to calibrate a camera. 

We will use Github for most of the work on the robot arm (the Universal Robotics UR3). Thus, the first step in working on the UR3 is to join Github. For instructions on setting up your Github account, please go to https://docs.github.com/en

Once you have Github installed and you are reading this, go to the repository named [Documentation](https://github.com/ENEE467/documentation.git) and follow the instructions there.
